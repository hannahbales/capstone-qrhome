    <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      <p>
        Our project is a cross-platform application designed to simplify the housing application process for individuals experiencing homelessness. 
        Our sponsors and their clients face lots of frustration when navigating long, repetitive forms, so we created a universal form that stores 
        personal, family, and other information securely. Then, a QR code can be scanned by case workers, allowing them to access their client's 
        information without needing the client to fill out the same information repeatedly and to retell their traumatic stories multiple times. 
        The application is designed to be user-friendly and simple to use for it's users.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application allows users to create secure accounts, input personal and family details, upload important documents, and generate a unique 
        QR code to easily share their information with case workers and housing providers. This improves efficiency, reduces emotional burden, and 
        makes resource navigation less daunting. Our app is accessible via web browsers and on mobile devices, allowing use in shelters, libraries, 
        and other public spaces. The key features include user authentication with optional two-factor verification, data sharing with permission 
        controls, document management, family tracking, and client-to-caseworker linking through QR codes. 
      </p>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      We built an application designed to help individuals and families experiencing homelessness with the goal of making the housing application 
      process simpler and easier. The application helps users to register, create families, enter their information, upload required documentation, 
      and generate a scannable QR code containing their information. This QR code acts as a digital connection between clients and case workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system is composed of a Flutter-based frontend, a Go-based backend API, and a PostgreSQL database for storage. For security, the app supports 
      account deletion, role-based access (clients, case workers, and admins), and optional two-factor authentication. Caseworkers may find it useful 
      to have all their clients information on a browser, after scanning multiple clients' QR codes, to help them find housing and other resources.
      The clients will have access to a phone, so it will be more accessible for them to have an app. So we made it cross-platform, so it can be used 
      on both web and mobile, if needed. 
    </p>
    <p>
      First we have the login page, where the user can enter their email and password.
      If they don't have an account, they can click on the "Create Account" button to register.
    </p>
    <img src="images/login.png" alt="Login Page" class="screenshot" />
    <p>
      This is the registration page, where the user can enter their information to create an account.
      They can enter their name, email, password, and confirm their password. They also will choose if they are a client or case worker as well as 
      enter their birthday date. 
    </p>
    <img src="images/signup.png" alt="Sign Up Page" class="screenshot" />
    <h3>Client View</h3>
    <p>
      This is the home page for clients, where the user can see their information and the QR code that they can share with their case worker.
      The navigation bar to the side allows the user to navigate to the Application Form, Family, your uploads, your connected caseworkers, app information, and 
      the Log Out Button. You can get to the navigation by pressing the hamburger button in the top left corner.
    </p>
    <img src="images/home1.png" alt="Home Page" class="screenshot" />
    <img src="images/home2.png" alt="Home Page with navigation" class="screenshot" />
    
    <p>
      When you select Application Form, the user can see their application form and fill it out.
      They can enter their personal information, family information, and other details required for the housing application. This is a long form,
      so we have a navigation bar at the top to show the user how far they are in the form and what sections are left. This is also where the user 
      can upload their documents, such as their ID, birth certificate, and other required documents. 
    </p>
    <img src="images/form1.png" alt="Screenshot of the form" class="screenshot" />
    <img src="images/form2.png" alt="Screenshot of the form" class="screenshot" />
    <img src="images/form3.png" alt="Screenshot of the form" class="screenshot" />
    <p>
      When you select Family, the user can see their family members and add or remove them from their family, as well as input their details 
      and information.
    </p>
    <img src="images/family.png" alt="Family Page" class="screenshot" />
    <p>
      When you select your uploads, the user can see their uploaded documents and delete them if they want to. This is where they upload documents
      such as their ID, birth certificate, and other required documents.
    </p>
    <img src="images/upload.png" alt="Uploads Page" class="screenshot" />
    <p>
      When you select your connections, the user can see their connected case workers and remove them if they want to. 
      This is to ensure that the user has control over who has access to their information. They can also see their email address.
    </p>
    <img src="images/yourConnections.png" alt="Family Page" class="screenshot" />
    <p>
      This is the settings page, where the user can see their account information. They can also delete their account if they 
      want to. This is also where the user can enable two-factor authentication, which will send a code to their email or phone number to verify their 
      identity when logging in.
    </p>
    <img src="images/accountSettings.png" alt="Settings Page" class="screenshot" />
    <h3>Case worker View</h3>
    <p>
      This is the home page for case workers, where the user can see their clients and access their information. They have the abilty to view their
      clients' families, application forms, and uploads. They can also remove clients from their dashboard. The only way to add clients is by scanning their QR 
      code, which will add them to the case worker's dashboard. This is to ensures that the only case worker has permission to access the client's
      personal information.
    </p>
    <img src="images/caseworkerDashboard.png" alt="Caseworker Dashboard" class="screenshot" />
    <p>
      This is the what shows when the case worker scans the QR code. It will show the client name and ask if add them to their dashboard.
